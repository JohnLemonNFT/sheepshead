## Picker Strategy

### Lead Trump
The picker theoretically has more trump than anyone else since they picked on a good hand and was able to use the blind cards. By leading trump, the picker can:
- Draw out 5 trump per trick, depleting opposition
- Likely has 4+ trump remaining after first lead
- Partner probably has 1+ trump, leaving only ~3 for opposition
- When called suit is eventually led, opposition trump should be exhausted

### Lead Queen of Clubs
- Automatically wins the first trick
- Bleeds 5 trump from opposition
- Less likelihood of called Ace being trumped later
- Establishes dominance early

### Never Let Opposition Lead
- Even if it means using your high Queen
- Maintaining control is critical

### Burying Strategy
- Try to eliminate two fail suits and retain only one
- This allows trumping any trick led with suits you don't have
- Picker CAN bury trump in special situations (when advantageous)

---

## Partner Strategy

### Lead Trump
- Same reasoning as picker - depletes opposition trump
- Lead Queen of Clubs if you have it (signals to picker you're partner)
- If no big queen, play small trump - picker can take trick

### Protect the Called Ace
- Keep the called Ace as long as possible
- Picker should have depleted trump by end of hand
- Better chance of Ace making it around without being trumped

### Keep Identity Secret
- Usually advantageous to stay hidden as long as possible
- Don't lead called suit right after it was played
- Let picker reveal you naturally

### Special Situations
- If no trump and picker is on the end: lead an Ace, or short suit
- If picker on end with Q♥ and one small trump: lead Q♥
- If three trump: protect the Q♥

---

## Defender (Opposition) Strategy

### Lead the Called Ace Suit
- Chances are one defender won't have the suit and can trump
- Picker and partner cannot play trump on this trick
- Many points likely to fall on this trick
- Reveals who the partner is early (know who to schmear to)

### "Long Thru / Short To" Rule
- **Picker in middle (not on end)**: Lead your LONG suit (most cards)
  - Partners after picker may be able to trump the trick
- **Picker on the end**: Lead your SHORT suit (fewest cards)
  - Hope picker has that fail suit and can't trump

### If Can't Lead Called Suit
- Lead your long suit (the fail suit you have the most of)

---

## When to Pick

Pick with at least one of these:
1. **Two high Queens** and leading or on the end
2. **Any two Queens** + another trump + points to bury
3. **Any Queen** + 3 more trump + points to bury
4. **Any 5 trump**

Most of the time you'll win with these hands. Conservative players might pass, but most should pick.

---

## General Tips

### Trump Management
- On a trump lead, 2nd and 3rd players should play LOW trump (don't waste high trump)
- Count trump during play - at minimum track Queens and Jacks
- If picker's side has high Queen, they win 75% of the time

### Schmearing
- "When in doubt, schmear" - correct about 60% of the time
- Give points to teammates winning tricks

### Points Before Power
- Give up a 10 or Ace if you can take a trick with remaining trump
- Don't waste high cards when low ones will do

### Called Ace
- Never call the same Ace suit as previous hand (poor shuffling = someone may be void)
- If picker leads, called Ace has 80% chance of walking
- If opposition leads, rate drops to 50%

### Reading the Game
- If a "chronic picker" passes, the blind is probably full of trump
- Count both trump and points if possible; if only one, track trump

---

## Statistics

- Picker wins **70%** of the time
- Picker has high Queen after blind **65%** of the time
- If picker's team has high Queen, they win **75%**
- Called Ace walks **80%** when picker leads, **50%** when opposition leads
- Schmearing is correct **~60%** of the time

---

---

## Calling Strategy (Which Ace to Call)

### Best Practices
1. **Call a suit you're void in ("Unknown")** - 80% chance of walking vs 50%
2. **Call a suit with the 10** - Partner plays A (11pts) + you play 10 (10pts) = 21 points
3. **Call your shortest suit** - Easier to identify partner early
4. **Never call a suit you buried** - Common beginner error!

### Unknown Ace (Advanced)
If you hold all three fail Aces, you can call an ace "Unknown":
- Place a face-down "under card" on the table
- Call an ace of a suit you have NO cards in
- This ace has much better chance of walking (you can't have it led through you)

### Special Cases
- **All fail aces held**: Call a 10 instead of an ace
- **Extremely rare**: Call a King if you have all aces and tens

### Hold Card Rule
- You MUST keep at least one card from the called suit
- When that suit is led, you MUST play your hold card
- Partner MUST play the called ace when that suit is led

---

## Partner Identification

### How to Identify the Partner

**Watch for these clues:**
1. **Schmearing to picker** - If someone plays A/10 to picker's trick, likely partner
2. **Leading trump (non-picker)** - Strong signal they're partner
3. **Not leading called suit** - Partner avoids leading it (would force ace out)
4. **Playing high on picker's tricks** - Giving points = teammate

**Partner revealed when:**
- Called suit is led and ace is played
- Partner plays called ace on final trick if never led

### Strategic Deception
- Partner should stay hidden as long as possible
- Don't schmear too obviously early
- Avoid leading trump if it reveals partnership

---

## Trump Counting

### Why Count Trump
- 14 trump total in deck
- Knowing trump distribution helps decision-making
- Essential for knowing when fail aces will "walk"

### What to Track (Skill Levels)

| Level | What to Track |
|-------|---------------|
| **Beginner** | Just Queens played |
| **Intermediate** | Queens and Jacks |
| **Advanced** | All trump + "Boss" card |
| **Expert** | Trump + running point total |

### Boss Card
The **Boss** is the highest unplayed trump:
- Starts as Q♣
- Changes as high trump are played
- Knowing the Boss helps decide when to play high

### Counting Tip
After each trick, note:
- How many trump fell
- Which high trump (Q/J) were played
- Who played trump vs who "failed off"

---

## Burying Strategy

### Goals When Burying
1. **Bury points** - They count toward your 61 (but risky)
2. **Create voids** - Eliminate entire fail suits to trump later
3. **Keep control cards** - Aces win tricks, don't bury them

### What to Bury (Priority)

| Priority | Cards to Bury | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Best | Fail 10s | 10 points, no control value |
| Good | Fail Kings | 4 points, low control |
| OK | Low fail (7,8,9) | Creates voids, no points |
| Bad | Fail Aces | Control cards, keep them! |
| Never | Queens/Jacks | Top trump, always keep |
| Rarely | Diamond trump | Need trump to win tricks |

### Critical Rule
**Never bury your only card from the called suit!**
- Common beginner mistake
- You MUST hold at least one card of the called suit

### Void Creation Strategy
- Better to have 2 clubs than 1 heart + 1 club
- Voids let you trump when that suit is led
- Ideal: Void in 2 suits, hold 1 fail suit + trump

---

## Schmearing Strategy

### What is Schmearing?
Schmearing is playing a high-point card (Ace or 10) into a trick that will be taken by your teammate, increasing the points earned on that trick.

### When to Schmear
1. **When teammate is guaranteed the trick** - If partner played Q♣ (highest trump), schmear freely
2. **When you have multiple high-point cards** - Safe to give one away
3. **When trick already has significant points** - Adding more makes it worth winning
4. **"When in doubt, schmear"** - Correct approximately 60% of the time

### When NOT to Schmear
1. **Don't risk your only schmear** - If you have just one 10 or Ace, wait for a sure opportunity
2. **When outcome is uncertain** - If opponent might still take the trick
3. **When it reveals you as partner** - Schmearing in front of picker signals you're partner

### Schmear vs Trump Dilemma
If caught between giving away points OR a high trump that will win a later trick:
- **Keep the trump** - A future trick will likely net more points AND give you the lead
- Points before power, but trump is future power

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Card Strength Confusion
- Aces and 10s outrank Kings (unlike most card games)
- Queens and Jacks are ALWAYS trump (regardless of suit)
- Diamond Ace/10 are trump, not fail cards

### Leading Mistakes
- **Leading trump as defender** - Helps the picker deplete opposition trump
- **Leading high points when picker is last** - Picker surveys trick before deciding

### Partner Play Mistakes
- **Playing called suit too early** - Wait as long as possible for it to "walk"
- **Revealing partnership** - Schmearing obviously signals you're partner

### Picking Mistakes
- **Picking thin in position 2** - Most dangerous seat, 3 players behind you
- **Not counting trump before picking** - Need solid trump count
- **Taking too long to decide** - Signals weakness, invites cracks

---

## Leaster Strategy

### What is a Leaster?
When everyone passes, the hand becomes a "leaster" - the goal reverses:
- **Objective**: Take the FEWEST points
- **No partners** - Every player for themselves
- **Blind handling**: Usually goes to whoever takes it (varies by house rules)

### Key Leaster Tactics
1. **Must take at least one trick** - You can't just duck everything
2. **Dump high cards on others' tricks** - Give your aces/tens to opponents
3. **Avoid taking tricks with points** - Let others win point-heavy tricks
4. **Trump is BAD** - High trump forces you to win tricks
5. **Low fail cards are GOOD** - Help you duck tricks

### Alternative: Taking Everything
Some groups allow winning a leaster by taking ALL 120 points (very rare).

### Leaster Warning Signs
- If a "chronic picker" passes, blind likely has trump
- Multiple passes = weak hands all around
- Be careful with high trump - might get stuck with points

---

## Scoring Bonuses

### Schneider (Double Stakes)
- Losing team gets **30 points or fewer**
- Picker team loses schneider: Pay 2x penalty
- Picker team wins schneider: Collect 2x reward

### Schwarz (Triple Stakes)
- Losing team takes **no tricks at all**
- Picker team loses schwarz: Pay 3x penalty
- Picker team wins schwarz: Collect 3x reward

### Strategic Implications
- When ahead, try to schneider opponents for bonus
- When behind, fight for 31+ points to avoid schneider
- Taking just ONE trick avoids schwarz

## Coaching Tips by Skill Level

### Beginner Tips
1. **Learn trump order first** - Q♣ > Q♠ > Q♥ > Q♦ > J♣ > J♠ > J♥ > J♦ > A♦ > 10♦...
2. **10s beat Kings** - Unusual but critical to remember
3. **All Queens/Jacks are trump** - Even Q♥ and J♠ are trump!
4. **Don't pick without 4+ trump** - Wait for better hands
5. **Follow suit is mandatory** - If you have the suit led, you must play it

### Intermediate Tips
1. **Lead trump as picker** - Bleeds out opponent trump
2. **Lead called suit as defender** - Forces partner reveal, might trump
3. **Count Queens and Jacks** - Know when high trump are gone
4. **Create voids when burying** - Lets you trump later
5. **Position matters** - On the end is best, position 2 is worst

### Advanced Tips
1. **Track the Boss** - Know the highest remaining trump
2. **Count points as you go** - Know if you need more tricks
3. **Long thru / Short to** - Adjust leads based on picker position
4. **Protect single schmear** - Don't risk your only counter
5. **Read the table** - Watch play patterns to identify partner

### Expert Tips
1. **Mauer detection** - Beware passers who might have strong hands
2. **Probability thinking** - 80% ace walks if you lead, 50% if they lead
3. **Crossfire positioning** - Keep lead in front of picker
4. **Sacrifice for control** - Sometimes losing high card gains board position
5. **Count all 32 cards** - Perfect card counting wins close games

## The Ten Commandments of Sheepshead

### 1. Lead trump when thou art the picker's partner
The picker usually has the most trump, so leading trump exhausts opponents' trump as they follow suit.

**Corollary: Don't burn thy partner out of trump.** Count trump! If few trump remain, a trump lead takes all trump off the table, leaving remaining tricks to highest fail (a crapshoot).

**Example:** Picker has two black queens, leads them for tricks 1-2. Partner has four trump (two black jacks high). After trick 3, only 2 trump remain. If partner leads trump now, they take picker's last trump too. Instead, partner should lead called suit - both can win tricks with their trump, then called suit as final trick.

### 2. Lead long into the picker
When not the picker, never lead trump unless:
- You have to
- You have boss trump (highest remaining)

Lead from your longest suit. Theory: more cards in a suit = better chance a partner can trump in, forcing picker to play higher trump or letting partner behind picker take the trick.

### 3. Don't send a boy to do a man's job
If you trump in, don't play too low - it lets someone behind you take it with a slightly higher trump. "Go high or go home."

### 4. Don't risk thy only schmear
Don't throw your only 10 or Ace on an early uncertain trick. If it's protected, wait for a sure chance to get it home.

### 5. Don't recrack without points to bury
A good recrack hand is rare in call-ace. Even with 4 tricks, you can lose if:
- Called suit gets hit for 30-35 points
- Opponent trumps a trick with 10/A of trump + schmeared points

**Rule:** Only recrack if you can bury 20+ points (takes pointers off table).

### 6. Don't pick thin in position 2
Second to dealer's left is the most dangerous spot:
- You don't have the lead
- Three players behind you can go over you or crack

**Common trap:** You pick in position 2, fail suit led (not called suit = leader isn't partner, doesn't have called suit). You trump in, someone goes over, leads called suit for partner to cut, then leads same fail suit again.

### 7. Don't take forever to decide whether to pick
If a hand's worth thinking over, it's worth picking. The longer you think, the more chance you give others to crack you.

### 8. Don't table talk
Let the cards speak for themselves.

### 9. Crack whenever possible
Math with double-on-bump: if you have >1/3 chance of winning, you should crack.
- Lose with schneider: -2 points
- Win: +4 points
- Break-even: 1/3 * 4 = 1.33 points vs 2/3 * -2 = -1.33 points

Most crack if they can hit the called suit.

### 10. Don't go alone when you could have called a partner
Share the karma! Take someone for a ride!

## Position-Based Strategy

### Picker Positions (numbered from dealer's left)
| Position | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 1 (Lead) | Low | You control the first trick |
| 2 | **Highest** | No lead, 3 players behind you |
| 3 | Medium | 2 players behind you |
| 4 | Medium | 1 player behind you |
| 5 (Dealer) | Low | On the end, good position |

### Leading Strategy by Picker Position
- **Picker in middle**: Lead LONG suit (most cards) - partners after picker may trump
- **Picker on end**: Lead SHORT suit - hope picker has that fail

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Picking Questions

**Q: How many trump do I need to pick?**
A: The general rule is **7+ trump and aces combined**. Five trump alone is usually pickable. Four trump with two Queens is good. Less than 3 trump is almost always a pass.

**Q: Is one Queen enough to pick?**
A: It depends on total trump count and position. One Queen with 5 total trump is borderline. Having Q♣ (highest) is much better than Q♦ (lowest queen). Position matters too - be more conservative in position 2.

**Q: What is "position 2" and why is it dangerous?**
A: Position 2 is the second seat to the dealer's left. It's the most dangerous because you don't have the lead AND three players act after you. They can all go over your plays or crack your pick.

**Q: What can I infer when multiple players pass?**
A: Be cautious. Multiple passes could mean trump is evenly distributed, OR players are "mauers" (cowards passing strong hands). The blind might have good trump, but late position picking is riskier.

**Q: What is a "mauer"?**
A: A mauer (German for "wall") is a player who passes on strong hands. It's considered cowardly play. The term is used derogatorily for overly conservative players.

---

### Partner & Called Ace Questions

**Q: When must I play the called ace?**
A: You **MUST** play the called ace the first time that suit is led, even if you have other cards in that suit. This is not optional - it's the rule that reveals the partner.

**Q: What if the called ace is in the blind?**
A: If you pick and find the ace you wanted to call in the blind, you must call a different suit. If you end up with all three fail aces, you can call a 10 instead.

**Q: Can I play the called ace whenever I want?**
A: No. You must hold the called ace until that suit is led (or until the last trick if it's never led). Playing it early when not forced reveals you unnecessarily.

**Q: What is a "hold card"?**
A: The picker must keep at least one card from the called suit. This card is played when that suit is led. It's called the "hold card" because you must hold onto it.

**Q: How do I identify who the partner is?**
A: Watch for signals: schmearing to the picker (playing high points), trumping in with A♦ (classic partner move), NOT leading the called suit. Partner is officially revealed when the called suit is led and they play the ace.

**Q: If I'm void in the called suit, how do I find my partner?**
A: Rely on defenders to lead the called suit (they often do to flush out the partner). With an 80% walk rate when picker leads trump first, the ace usually wins anyway.

---

### Playing Strategy Questions

**Q: When should I schmear vs save my Ace?**
A: "Don't risk your only schmear" - if you have just ONE high-point card and it's protected, wait for a sure trick. If your teammate is definitely winning and the trick is worth 10+ points, schmear. If unsure, save the Ace for control.

**Q: Should I trump my partner's winning trick?**
A: Generally no - trust your partner to win. Only trump if a defender behind you could trump higher, or it's late game and you absolutely need those points.

**Q: What does "Long thru, Short to" mean?**
A: It's a defender strategy based on picker position. Lead your LONG suit if picker is in the middle (partners may trump after picker plays). Lead your SHORT suit if picker is on the end (you might create a void to trump later).

**Q: As 2nd or 3rd player, should I play high trump on a trump lead?**
A: No! Play LOW trump to save your high trump for later. Let teammates behind you handle the trick. This preserves your best cards for when they matter more.

---

### Burying Questions

**Q: Should I bury aces?**
A: **Never bury fail aces!** Aces are control cards that WIN tricks. Bury 10s instead - same 10 points but 10s can't beat aces. The only ace you might consider is if you're desperate to create a void.

**Q: Is creating a void worth sacrificing points?**
A: Usually yes. A void lets you trump in on that suit for the rest of the game. The ability to win tricks you couldn't otherwise win usually outweighs a few buried points.

**Q: What's the best bury strategy?**
A: Priority order: (1) Fail 10s - 10 points, no control value. (2) Fail Kings - 4 points, low control. (3) Low fail cards if they create a void. Never bury Queens/Jacks (top trump) or fail Aces (control cards).

**Q: What if I accidentally bury the called ace?**
A: This is a misdeal. The picker pays the board (one point to each player). The hand is replayed.

---

### Leaster Questions

**Q: What is a leaster?**
A: When everyone passes, the hand becomes a leaster. The goal reverses - take the FEWEST points to win. No partners, everyone plays for themselves.

**Q: What happens to the blind in a leaster?**
A: House rules vary. Common options: blind goes to whoever takes the last trick, first trick, or is split between first and last. Some groups set it aside entirely.

**Q: Do I have to take a trick to win a leaster?**
A: Most groups require taking at least one trick to qualify for winning. You can't just duck everything. Some groups allow winning with 0 points if you take exactly one trick worth 0.

**Q: What's the strategy for leaster?**
A: Dump your aces and tens on others' tricks. Avoid taking tricks with points. Trump is bad (forces you to win). Low fail cards are good (help you duck). Use high trump to "buy" a cheap trick if needed.

---

### Rules Clarification Questions

**Q: Can the picker look at the buried cards during play?**
A: **No.** The picker must memorize what they buried before play begins. They cannot look at those cards again until the hand is over.

**Q: Is the Ace of Diamonds a fail card?**
A: No! The Ace of Diamonds is trump (the 9th highest trump). Many beginners forget this. All diamonds are trump.

**Q: If I only have the called ace (no other cards in that suit), can I play it anytime?**
A: No. You must wait until the called suit is led, or until the last trick if it's never led. Having only the ace doesn't change this rule.

**Q: In what order do 10s and Kings rank?**
A: **10s beat Kings** in Sheepshead (unlike most card games). Within fail suits: A > 10 > K > 9 > 8 > 7.

---

### Counting & Tracking Questions

**Q: How do I count trump during play?**
A: Start knowing there are 14 trump total. After each trick, note how many trump fell and which high ones (Q/J). Minimum: track when Queens are played. Better: track Queens AND Jacks. Best: track all trump.

**Q: What is the "Boss" card?**
A: The Boss is the highest unplayed trump remaining. It starts as Q♣. After Q♣ is played, Q♠ becomes Boss, etc. Knowing the Boss helps decide when to play high.

**Q: How do I estimate if my team is winning mid-hand?**
A: Track points won by each side. Assume picker buried ~10 points (average). Total points = 120. Picker needs 61 to win. Compare your running total to the goal.

---

### Scoring Questions

**Q: What is Schneider?**
A: Schneider is when the losing team gets 30 points or fewer. It results in double stakes/penalty for the losers.

**Q: What is Schwarz?**
A: Schwarz (also called "no-tricker") is when the losing team takes no tricks at all. It results in triple stakes/penalty.

**Q: How do I avoid Schwarz?**
A: Take at least ONE trick. Even a trick worth 0 points avoids the Schwarz penalty.

---

### Etiquette Questions

**Q: Can I talk about my hand during play?**
A: No. "Thou shalt not table talk" is one of the Ten Commandments of Sheepshead. Let the cards speak for themselves.

**Q: How long should I take to decide whether to pick?**
A: Don't take forever! If a hand is worth thinking about, it's probably worth picking. Taking too long signals weakness and gives opponents time to plan cracks.

### Advanced Strategy Questions

**Q: When should I go alone instead of calling a partner?**
A: Go alone when: (1) You have all 3 fail aces (forced), (2) You have 6+ trump AND 2+ fail aces, (3) Your hand is a "granny hand" (so strong anyone could win), or (4) You're "stuck" (no valid suit to call).

**Q: What is "cracking"?**
A: Cracking is doubling the stakes after someone picks. With "double on the bump" rules, if you have >1/3 chance of winning, you should crack.

**Q: How do defenders coordinate without talking?**
A: Through card play signals only. Leading called suit = "hunting the partner." Setting up a crossfire keeps picker in the middle. Sacrifice points before power (save trump for later).

**Q: What is the A♦ partner signal?**
A: Trumping in with the Ace of Diamonds is a classic "partner move." It signals to the picker that you're on their team, because a defender wouldn't waste their highest-point trump card like that.

**Q: What does "crossfire" mean in defense?**
A: Crossfire is a defensive positioning strategy. Defenders try to keep the lead "in front of" the picker, so they play before the picker and can force difficult decisions. When two defenders are positioned to play before and after the picker, they create a crossfire.

**Q: When should picker stop leading trump?**
A: When most trump are exhausted (after 2-3 trump leads typically), switch to leading called suit to find your partner or lead fail to collect points. The goal of trump leads is achieved when opponents are out of trump - then fail aces will "walk."

**Q: What is a "granny hand"?**
A: A granny hand is an extremely powerful hand that's nearly impossible to lose - typically 6+ high trump including multiple queens. Named because "even your grandmother could win with it." Some groups play granny hands differently (auto-win, double stakes, etc.).

## Common Rule Variants

The following are popular house rule variants. Our app currently uses "Standard 5-Player Called Ace" rules.

### Cracking / Recracking (Doubling Stakes)
When someone picks, any other player can "crack" (double the stakes). The picker can then "recrack" (double again). Some groups use "double on the bump" scoring where cracking is mathematically correct if you have >1/3 chance of winning.

**Status**: Not yet implemented - potential future feature.

### Blitzing (Black/Red Queens)
A player with both black queens (Q♣ and Q♠) can reveal them before picking to automatically double the stakes. Similarly, revealing both red queens doubles. Having all four queens = quadruple stakes.

**Status**: Not yet implemented - potential future feature.

### Jack of Diamonds Partner
Instead of calling an ace, the partner is determined by whoever holds the Jack of Diamonds. The Jack holder plays anonymously until revealed. This simplifies partner calling but removes strategic choice.

**Status**: Not yet implemented - simpler variant that could be added.

### Mauer Points (Pass Penalty)
Some groups penalize mauering (passing on strong hands). When everyone passes, hands are revealed and mauer points counted - each trump except queens = ½ mauer point, queens = 1 point. Highest mauer point total pays the table.

**Status**: Not yet implemented - could add as optional penalty.

### Leaster Variants
Different groups handle leasers differently:
- **Blind to last trick**: Winner of last trick gets the blind
- **Blind to first trick**: Winner of first trick gets the blind
- **Blind ignored**: Set aside, not used
- **Most points wins**: Opposite of traditional leaster

**Status**: Our app uses "traditional leaster" (fewest points wins).

### Doubler (Alternative to Leaster)
When everyone passes, instead of playing leaster, stakes double and the hand is redealt. This penalizes mauers by raising stakes until someone picks.

**Status**: Not yet implemented - potential alternative to leaster.

### Forced Pick (Dealer Must Pick)
If everyone passes, the dealer MUST pick regardless of hand strength. Prevents endless passing and forces action.

**Status**: Our app allows this optionally.
