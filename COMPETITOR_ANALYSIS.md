## DETAILED COMPLAINTS WITH QUOTES

### 1. AI DECISION MAKING - THE #1 COMPLAINT (45+ mentions)

#### Partner doesn't trump/take tricks they should:
- *"Partners will often not trump called suit trick"*
- *"AI doesn't trump the called ace, leads Trump when not the partner, doesn't smear. Lousy programming."*
- *"When a partner is able to take the called ace trick they don't and often even throws points on it"*
- *"Partner leads the called suite right in front of the picker after called suite was just played"*

#### Partner doesn't schmear:
- *"Who doesn't schmear points when their team has the trick won as the last one to play?"*
- *"Partners will often not smear where appropriate"*
- *"Won't smear and other errors"*
- *"Close to real play but quite a few goofs. Opponent will lead back trump, won't smear"*

#### AI holds trump when shouldn't:
- *"Holding on to trump and screwing your partners…just ugh!!!"*
- *"See too many holding queens and sometimes 3 go down on last trick"*
- *"Tendency to hold trump until the last trick or two"*
- *"Comp player has 10♦ plays 10♣ giving picker extra points when could have played 10 of trump"*

#### AI leads trump when they shouldn't (NON-PICKER):
- *"These computer people play like idiots!!! They lead trump all the time when they're NOT partners!!!"*
- *"Non-pickers shouldn't lead trump so often into the picker"*
- *"You don't lead trump when you're not the picker unless you're trump tight"*
- *"Really poor strategy to bleed your partners out of trump"*
- *"Non pickers leading trump, namely Ace and Ten of Diamonds in first couple of tricks"*
- *"Trump is lead way too often by the team against the picker. Why would you want to consistently run your partners out of trump?"*

#### AI picks with terrible hands:
- *"AI picks in front of me with absolutely nothing for them to pick on"*
- *"Ridiculous picks by the AI"*
- *"The pickers sometimes have no real chance of winning"*
- *"The AI will pick the blind on way too little power"*
- *"When an AI player picks when you have all queens and all trump, then doesn't manage even one trick, it's pretty pathetic"*
- *"Computer should not be doing this to others [picking with no chance]"*

#### Specific examples of terrible plays:
- *"Picker has diamond ace and J-hearts on trick, plays 10-diamonds UNDER the jack to lose 20+ point trick"*
- *"Player didn't play trump when trump was led and they had it in hand"*
- *"Five queens were played"* (impossible - only 4 exist!)
- *"Cards show up twice in a game"*
- *"Partners stealing tricks already won"*
- *"Constant bad leads"*
- *"If I played like this app, I'd be kicked out of my family and Wisconsin!"*

### 2. CARD DEALING FEELS RIGGED (25+ mentions)

#### Users tracking statistics:
- *"93% of the time the picker's partner covers the picker's fail, unless I pick, then it's about 9%"*
- *"I get less than 2 trump almost 88% of the time"*
- *"Kept track of 60 games and I was only able to be the picker on two of those"*
- *"Over 100+ tournament games, rarely finish in top positions"*
- *"Played for over 2 hours straight without getting dealt a hand worth picking on"*

#### General complaints:
- *"I usually get from 1-3 trump and they usually are not high trump"*
- *"Hand after hand after hand of fail"*
- *"Rarely get a picking hand"*
- *"Way too many crap hands - three 7s, two 8s, two 7s and maybe 1 trump"*
- *"You either get all trump or no trump. Certainly not random."*
- *"The game is very unrealistic"*
- *"Computer seems to know each other's cards and coordinate from the first card"*
- *"I do not feel like the AI players are making decisions based on only what they have seen"*
- *"I don't even think the shuffling is fair. I wish it was."*

- *"How do you go alone?"*

#### Blitz/Crack (5 mentions):
- *"Where is the blitz and the crack???"*
- *"Why can't we blitz reds or blitz blacks to make the hand worth more points?"*
- *"U should be able to crack and recrack the picker so the stakes are doubled or tripled"*

- *"Annoying to pick up where you left off and forget who's who"*
- *"Doesn't show partner or suit chosen"*
- *"Please please mark the partner - after they expose themselves, of course"*

#### Hand history (4 mentions):
- *"Would be nice to look at the previous hands"*
- *"Post-hand trick review"*

#### Speed/Animation controls:
- *"Pretty slow graphically with unnecessary spinning cards"*
- *"Would also be nice if a player has the rest of the tricks that it would just lay the cards down"*
- *"Game would be faster if it just laid down the cards and ended the hand"*

- *"Great customization options"*
- *"Being from Wisconsin, Sheepshead is part of who we are"*

## COMPETITOR WEAKNESSES SUMMARY

The competitor has **2,381 ratings at 4.5 stars** but reading the reviews reveals:

1. **Users settle because there's no better option** - "almost no other offline options"
2. **Even 5-star reviews complain about AI** - fundamental issues
3. **Users are tracking statistics** - they don't trust the app
4. **Missing basic features** - go alone, blitz, crack
5. **5-handed mode is broken** - our target market

**This is a market ready to switch.** Users are actively frustrated but have no alternative. We can be that alternative.
